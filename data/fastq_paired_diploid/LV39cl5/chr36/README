Starting with the bam file containing all reads mapped against the chr 1 reference:

Extract only reads where both the read and it's mate are aligned:
samtools collate -u -O LV39cl5_chr36.bam | samtools fastq -F 12 -1 LV39cl5_chr36_1.fq -2 LV39cl5_chr36_2.fq -0 /dev/null -s /dev/null -n &

New fastq files contain 536465 reads.

Map these back to the chr 1 reference to check that these are what we want:
hisat2 -p 6 -k 1 --no-spliced-alignment -x ../../../genome_diploid_index/genome_diploid_chr36 -1 LV39cl5_chr36_1.fq -2 LV39cl5_chr36_2.fq 2> LV39cl5_chr36.log | samtools view -bS | samtools sort -T LV39cl5_chr36 > LV39cl5_chr36.bam &
samtools index LV39cl5_chr36.bam

Log shows 100% of reads mapped.
