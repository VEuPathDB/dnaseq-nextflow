Starting with the bam file containing all reads mapped against the chr 1 reference:

Extract only reads where both the read and it's mate are aligned:
samtools collate -u -O SRR538819.bam | samtools fastq -F 12 -1 SRR538819_chr1_1.fq -2 SRR538819_chr1_2.fq -0 /dev/null -s /dev/null -n

New fastq files contain 109833 reads.

Map these back to the chr 1 reference to check that these are what we want:
hisat2 -p 6 -k 1 --no-spliced-alignment -x ../genome_haploid_index/premade_index -1 SRR538819_chr1_1.fq.gz -2 SRR538819_chr1_2.fq.gz 2> SRR538819_chr1.log | samtools view -bS | samtools sort -T SRR538819 > SRR538819_chr1.bam
samtools index SRR538819_chr1.bam

Log shows 100% of reads mapped.
